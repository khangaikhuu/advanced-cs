<h1>Cats</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The domestic cat (Felis catus or Felis silvestris catus) is a small, typically furry, domesticated,

and carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when

there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for

companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds; different

associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. The International Progressive Cat

Breeders Alliance (IPCBA) recognizes 73 cat breeds while TICA (The International Cat Association)

recognizes 58, CFA (The Cat Fanciers' Association) recognizes 44 and Federation International Feline

(FIFE) recognizes 43.</p>

Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp

retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory

ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those

made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have

poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a

social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring,

trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body

language.[8]

<h1>Dogs</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is a domesticated canid which has been

selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

Although initially thought to have originated as a manmade variant of an extant canid species (variously

supposed as being the dhole, golden jackal, or gray wolf), extensive genetic studies undertaken during

the 2010s indicate that dogs diverged from an extinct wolf-like canid in Eurasia 40,000 years ago. Being

the oldest domesticated animal, their long association with people has allowed dogs to be uniquely

attuned to human behavior, as well as thrive on a starch-rich diet which would be inadequate for other

canid species.</p>
<h3>In Popular Culture</h3>
<p>Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting

police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on

human society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures,

however, dogs are a source of meat.</p>
